**Research**

*<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jtw5p/">When Working Memory is Just Working, not Memory</a>*

Incorporated my <a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01np193d22j">senior thesis</a> research, in which I built a model of episodic memory retrieval of sequential stimuli based on drifting context representations, and showed that this model exhibited performance phenomena classically attributed to working memory constraints. Many thanks to my advisor Jon Cohen.


*<a href="https://electionemails2020.org/"> Princeton Corpus of Political Emails</a>*

Project based on my <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/maia_hamin_spring_2019.pdf">junior paper</a>, in which I modified a web crawler to sign up for email lists on campaign websites and built an analysis pipeline to study questions like what topics candidates were mentioning in emails and how often they used deceptive techniques. Many thanks to my advisor Arvind Narayanan and the rest of the team at CITP who turned my prototype into this research asset.

*Authorship Attribution through Word-Pair Measures of Custom Embedding Similarity*

Another junior paper, in which I built a model to generate custom word embeddings from single-author corpora, and showed that a geometric comparison of word embeddings could predict shared authorship with high accuracy. Many thanks to my advisor Brian Kernighan.
