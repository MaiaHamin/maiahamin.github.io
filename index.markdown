**Biography:**

I'm currently a <a href="https://www.techcongress.io">TechCongress</a> fellow serving in the office of Senator Ron Wyden. I've been analyzing and writing legislation and letters on consumer privacy, responsible AI, government-used tech, surveillance oversight, and future-of-money.

Before that I was a software engineer on the Privacy and Civil Liberties team at Palantir for a year and a half. I spent most of my time building products for data governance and privacy -- I was a full-stack+ engineer, designing and building things from APIs and data stores to front-end features and performance metrics, and working with customers to set up governance tools and integrate their feature needs back into the product. I co-ran a program called the PCL Vanguard, coordinating an internal course on privacy and civil liberties  for cohorts of employees from throughout the company and mentoring them through a project to advance PCL in their core work area.

Before that I was getting my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Princeton, with certificates in Cognitive Science and Technology and Society. I worked as a mentor at the AI4All program, a research assistant in the Eviction Lab, and a grader for a machine learning course. I ran the <a href="https://issuu.com/tigermagazine">Princeton Tiger</a>, a humor magazine of ill repute, and co-ran <a href="https://interface.cs.princeton.edu/">INTERFACE</a>, a discussion group on issues at the intersection of computing tech and society.

**Goals and Interests**

Broadly, my goal is to work on governance for data and computing tech. The pieces of that puzzle probably involve policy that incentivizes the development of beneficial, values-aligned tech, and prevents bad attractor states in the relationships between humans, companies, and data technology. I try to be thoughtful in identifying and articulating potential harms, mindful about tradeoffs, and always grounded in the realm of technical fact when thinking about solutions.

I'm always trying to learn more about:

- how to make AI and autonomous systems more safe, safely used, and well-understood;

- privacy-enhancing technology and clever models for data access;

- tradeoffs in online speech and expression, hard problems in content moderation; and

- human cognition and decision-making and the nature of intelligence.
